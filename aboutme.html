                        pursuing an education in Electrical Engineering.
                        I decided to study engineering because I wanted
                        to innovate new ideas and help others with my
                        work (as well as heavily enjoying math and science
                        in high school!).

                coding, a field that once intimidated me when
                I was younger, was actually really fun. As a result,
                my newfound <i>passion for developing</i> has
                compelled me to embark on a journey of 
                formulating various coding projects!

                        I open source all my projects so that everyone
                        can access them. Many of my projects include the use of
                        C++, JS, HTML/CSS, etc. I have made chrome extensions, discord
                        bots, websites, calculators and other various programs!
